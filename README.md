# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem I was solving for the projects in this course were, figuring out whether a binary tree, vector, or hash table would be best for sorting out computer science classes. The answer I chose was hash table but after feedback I learned that binary trees are best for this problem. The second problem I was solving was coding the data type to work for the computer science classes as well as make a menu to access the class properly as will as search for the classes.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by thinking about which data type I know how to use best which in this case were vectors, off of my knowledge of vectors I looked back through other code that I have written for vectors and applied certain areas of that code into my own code to help me solve my problem. I also struggled on figuring out how I could make the vector print alphabetically so I did research on what other people have coded to make their lists alphabetical and tried to understand how it works and then tried to apply that code into my own style. Understanding data structures helps a lot when it comes to projects like these because knowing what you can do with the data structure regarding functions helps you smooth sail through the project.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The work on this project evolved how much I write when it comes to notes, I used to write essentially a summary of what my code does with no regard on who might read my notes for my code. Now I write my notes assuming that who is reading my notes has no idea how code works to help them understand what the code essentially does.
